# AVL-Tree-Visualization
Visualizing AVL was never been this easier

Design And Analysis of Algorithms Project
AVL Tree Visualisation and Using it to store student information.
To view the project ,please do the following.
1)Extract the files to a folder.
2)Rename the text file avl_code.txt to avl_code.js
3)Rename the text file d3.min.txt to d3.min.js

After doing the following changes,click on the front.html file,it will lead you to the front page of the website.
In the front page,there is a link called "Click To Try Implementation".
Clicking on the link will lead you to another page.
In that page,if we simply want to store only the keys,we have to enter only the values of the keys.
If we want to store the student information,before inserting ,click on the display fields button,which will show
us three more fields "Name","SRN","Age".
Enter the information along with the values for the key everytime we want to store 
student information.
A search for a valid key without data for student fields will return a message stating that the key is 
found and empty values for student information fields.  
Thank you
