# AVL-Tree-Visualization
Visualizing AVL was never been this easier

Design And Analysis of Algorithms Project <br>
AVL Tree Visualisation and Using it to store student information.<br>
To view the project ,please do the following.<br>
1)Extract the files to a folder.<br>
2)Rename the text file avl_code.txt to avl_code.js<br>
3)Rename the text file d3.min.txt to d3.min.js<br>

After doing the following changes,click on the front.html file,it will lead you to the front page of the website.<br>
In the front page,there is a link called "Click To Try Implementation".<br>
Clicking on the link will lead you to another page.<br>
In that page,if we simply want to store only the keys,we have to enter only the values of the keys.<br>
If we want to store the student information,before inserting ,click on the display fields button,which will show
us three more fields "Name","SRN","Age".<br>
Enter the information along with the values for the key everytime we want to store 
student information.<br>
A search for a valid key without data for student fields will return a message stating that the key is 
found and empty values for student information fields.  <br>
Thank you
